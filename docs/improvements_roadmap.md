# Improvements & Roadmap

This document outlines potential improvements and future development directions for the Faction Manager application. It includes both features that would enhance the user experience and technical improvements that would make the system more robust.

## Current Limitations

Based on examination of the codebase, here are some current limitations:

1. **Limited Search Capabilities**: No robust search functionality across factions, projects, or events.

2. **Basic UI**: The current interface is functional but could benefit from modernization.

3. **No Mobile Optimization**: The interface isn't fully responsive for tablet/mobile use at the game table.

4. **Limited Data Visualization**: No graphical timeline or relationship mapping.

5. **Manual Updates Only**: All data must be entered manually; no automation for recurring events.

6. **Limited Export Options**: No way to export data for external use or reporting.

7. **No Authentication System**: No user accounts or access control for collaborative campaigns.
