# Game Master's Guide to Faction Manager

## Introduction

Faction Manager is a web-based tool designed to help Game Masters (GMs) track factions, their projects, and the evolving timeline in their tabletop roleplaying games. This guide will walk you through how to effectively use Faction Manager to enhance your game by keeping track of the various organizations and their activities in your game world.

## Core Concepts

### Factions

Factions are organizations, groups, or entities in your game world that have their own goals, resources, and motivations. They might be:

- Criminal syndicates
- Noble houses or political parties
- Guilds or merchant companies
- Religious orders or cults
- Resistance movements or revolutionary groups

Each faction has a **tier** indicating their relative power and influence, along with descriptions of their **goals**, **leadership**, **values**, and **history**.

### Projects

Projects represent activities or endeavors that factions undertake to achieve their goals. Examples include:

- Building a new headquarters
- Researching a magical artifact
- Establishing trade routes
- Infiltrating a rival organization
- Recruiting new members

Each project has a **length** value (typically 2-20) which determines how much progress is needed to complete it. Progress is tracked through events.

### Events

Events represent important occurrences in your game world. They can be:

- Direct results of player actions
- Activities that happen "off-screen"
- Major world events that affect multiple factions

Events are tied to a specific point in the game timeline using the **when** value.

### Sessions

Sessions represent your actual gameplay sessions. They mark when your group met to play and what happened during that time. The most recent session's **when** value determines the current time in your game world.

## Getting Started with a Campaign

### Step 1: Create a New Game

Start by creating a new game that represents your campaign:

1. From the home page, click "Create New Game"
2. Give it a name and description
3. Click "Save"

### Step 2: Define Your Time Units

Decide what the "when" values represent in your game:

- For a short campaign, each unit might be a day
- For a long-running game, each unit might be a week or month
- For a historical saga, each unit might be a year

### Step 3: Create Initial Factions

For each major organization in your world:

1. From your game's dashboard, click "Add Faction"
2. Fill in details:
   - Name and description
   - Tier level (1-5 typically, with 5 being most powerful)
   - Goals, leadership, values, and history
3. Click "Save"

Try to create at least 3-5 factions to start with, focusing on groups that will be most relevant to your story.

### Step 4: Create Initial Projects

For each faction, consider what they're working on:

1. From a faction's detail page, click "Add New Project"
2. Fill in:
   - Name and description
   - Select which faction(s) are involved
   - Set a length value (how much effort needed to complete)
3. Click "Save"

Each faction should have at least one active project to start.

## Running Your Game

### Before Each Session

1. Review active projects to understand what factions are doing
2. Plan how faction activities might intersect with player actions
3. Consider what progress factions make on projects that happen "off-screen"

### After Each Session

1. Create a new Session record with the correct "when" value
2. Create Event records for important happenings
3. Update project progress through these events
4. Review which projects completed and what new projects might begin

## Best Practices for GMs

### Maintaining Faction Activity

Even when players aren't directly interacting with a faction, you should:

1. Periodically advance projects for "background" factions
2. Create events to mark major achievements
3. Consider how completed projects might spawn new ones

### Using Tiers Effectively

Faction tiers can be used to:

- Determine how much progress they make on projects (higher tier = faster progress)
- Calculate their resources and manpower
- Evaluate outcomes when factions come into conflict

A good rule of thumb: for each tier difference, the higher tier faction makes approximately 1-2 additional points of progress per time unit on their projects.

### Creating Narrative Through Timeline

The timeline view gives you a powerful tool for creating narrative:

1. Look for convergences (multiple events happening at the same time)
2. Note when projects complete and consider the ripple effects
3. Use project completion to trigger new events and storylines

### Involving Players

While Faction Manager is primarily a GM tool, you can enhance player engagement by:

1. Sharing faction details when characters would have that knowledge
2. Using project progress as hooks for missions or quests
3. Letting successful player actions create Events that advance faction projects

## Advanced Techniques

### Modeling Complex Relationships

You can represent complex faction relationships by:

1. Creating projects that involve multiple factions (collaborative efforts)
2. Setting up competing projects with opposing goals
3. Creating "relationship" projects that track how factions feel about each other

### Dynamic World Events

For a living, breathing world:

1. After every 2-3 sessions, review all factions and create at least one event for each
2. For every major player action, consider how it affects at least 2-3 faction projects
3. Periodically introduce new factions or have existing ones change their tier level

### Long-Term Campaign Management

For campaigns spanning months or years of real time:

1. Archive completed projects but keep their events for historical reference
2. Periodically review and update faction goals and values as they evolve
3. Consider "epoch" changes where multiple factions shift in response to world events

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Too Many Active Projects**: If you're feeling overwhelmed, focus on 2-3 projects per faction maximum
- **Stagnant Timeline**: If no projects are advancing, reduce project lengths or increase progress per event
- **One Faction Dominates**: Balance by increasing other factions' tiers or creating alliance projects

## Conclusion

Faction Manager shines when used consistently to track the evolving state of your game world. By maintaining records of factions, projects, and events, you create a rich tapestry of interconnected stories that make your world feel alive and responsive to player actions.
