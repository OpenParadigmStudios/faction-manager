# GM Tips & Tricks

This document provides advanced tips and techniques for getting the most out of Faction Manager in your roleplaying games.

## General Usage Tips

### Efficient Data Entry

1. **Batch Your Updates**: After a session, make all your updates at once: create the session record, add events, and update project progress in one sitting.

2. **Use Copy & Paste**: When creating multiple related events (e.g., "Day 1 Construction", "Day 2 Construction"), create the first one completely then use copy/edit for subsequent entries.

3. **Browser Bookmarks**: Create bookmarks for your most frequently accessed views (your current game page, active projects list, faction list) to save navigation time.

### Consistent Naming Conventions

Adopt consistent naming patterns to make information easier to find:

1. **Events**: Use a format like "[Faction] - [Action]" (e.g., "Thieves Guild - Warehouse Heist")

2. **Projects**: Use active verbs (e.g., "Building..." instead of "Build...", "Researching..." instead of "Research...")

3. **Time Markers**: If your "when" values represent dates, consider including them in event names (e.g., "[Month 3] Border Skirmish")

## Advanced Gameplay Techniques

### Faction Relationship Tracking

Track relationships between factions by:

1. **Relationship Projects**: Create projects specifically to track how factions feel about each other, with names like "Relations with [Faction]" and progress representing goodwill (negative changes for deteriorating relations).

2. **Relationship Events**: Create specific events for diplomatic meetings, betrayals, or alliances with appropriate project changes.

3. **Alliance Tracking**: Use shared projects that benefit multiple factions to represent alliances and cooperation.

### NPC Development Through Factions

Link important NPCs to factions to make them more dynamic:

1. **Leadership Changes**: Create events when faction leadership changes, potentially modifying faction goals or creating new projects.

2. **NPC Storylines**: Create small-scale projects (length 2-4) that represent personal goals of faction-affiliated NPCs.

3. **Promotion Tracking**: Use projects to track an NPC's rise through faction ranks (e.g., "Promotion to Captain" project for a City Watch member).

### Player Faction Integration

If players form or join an existing faction:

1. **Player-Controlled Projects**: Allow players to propose and initiate projects for their faction.

2. **Resource Allocation**: Have players decide how to allocate their faction's effort between multiple active projects.

3. **Character Integration**: Create projects that directly involve player character background elements to increase investment.

## Creative Uses of the System

### Tracking Non-Organization Entities

The faction system can track more than just organizations:

1. **Locations as "Factions"**: Track cities, dungeons, or regions as factions with projects representing developments in those locations.

2. **Natural Forces**: Track weather patterns, magical anomalies, or planar influences as "factions" with projects representing their evolution.

3. **Abstract Concepts**: Track things like "Public Opinion" or "Kingdom Stability" as factions with projects representing shifts in these abstractions.

### Alternative Project Types

Projects can represent many different types of activities:

1. **Construction Projects**: Building physical structures with progress representing completion stages.

2. **Research Projects**: Discovering information or developing new abilities.

3. **Social Projects**: Spreading influence, changing minds, or affecting reputation.

4. **Military Projects**: Preparing for war, training troops, or conducting campaigns.

5. **Subterfuge Projects**: Spying, infiltration, or manipulation operations.

### Using Finished Projects as History

Completed projects provide a rich historical record:

1. **Story Arc Completion**: When a major storyline concludes, create a special event linking all completed projects that contributed to it.

2. **Time Capsules**: After significant in-game time passes, review completed projects to help inform how the world has changed.

3. **Project References**: In new project descriptions, reference completed projects to create continuity (e.g., "Following the successful Temple Reconstruction project...").

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Managing Complexity

If your game has grown complex with many factions and projects:

1. **Faction Tags**: Create an informal tagging system in faction descriptions (e.g., [ACTIVE], [BACKGROUND], [DORMANT]) to indicate which need regular attention.

2. **Project Prioritization**: Mark projects with [KEY] or [MINOR] in their descriptions to help focus your attention.

3. **Periodic Cleanup**: Regularly review and archive completed projects, keeping only active ones in your main views.

### Balancing Progress Rates

If project progress seems too fast or slow:

1. **Adjust Length Values**: If projects complete too quickly, use larger length values (10-20 instead of 4-8).

2. **Progress Benchmarks**: For consistency, decide standard progress amounts:
   - Minor effort: +1 progress
   - Standard effort: +2 progress 
   - Major effort: +3 progress
   - Exceptional success: +4 or +5 progress

3. **Tier-Based Progress**: Standard progress per time unit could be equal to faction tier (Tier 1 = +1, Tier 5 = +5).

### Recalibrating Timeline

If your timeline gets out of sync with your campaign:

1. **Timeline Audit**: Periodically compare "when" values with your campaign calendar to ensure consistency.

2. **Session Zero Point**: Use session records to mark campaign breaks with notes about timeline adjustments.

3. **Flexible Interpretation**: Remember that "when" values are abstractions - they can represent anything from hours to years depending on your campaign's needs.

## Campaign-Specific Adaptations

### For Political Campaigns

1. **Influence Projects**: Create projects specifically tracking political influence in different regions or among demographic groups.

2. **Voting Systems**: Track election or parliamentary voting through projects where completion represents securing enough votes.

3. **Law Projects**: Create projects representing the passage of new laws, with progress tracking the legislative process.

### For Military Campaigns

1. **Battle Preparation**: Create projects for army recruitment, training, and equipment.

2. **Territory Control**: Track territorial control using projects where progress represents secure hold on regions.

3. **Supply Lines**: Create projects representing supply chain development with progress tracking security and efficiency.

### For Urban Adventures

1. **District Projects**: Create projects related to specific city districts with progress affecting those areas.

2. **Crime Tracking**: Use projects to track crime waves with progress representing how widespread the problem becomes.

3. **Business Development**: Track economic development through projects representing new businesses or trade.

## Advanced Timeline Techniques

### Forecasting Future Events

Use the system to plan future developments:

1. **Scheduled Events**: Create placeholder events in the future with "when" values beyond current game time.

2. **Completion Forecasting**: Estimate when projects will complete based on typical progress rates.

3. **Conditional Events**: Create notes about events that will trigger when certain projects reach specific progress milestones.

### Time-Sensitive Projects

Some projects may be time-sensitive:

1. **Deadline Projects**: Note in the project description that it must complete before a certain "when" value.

2. **Race Projects**: Create competing projects where the first to complete has significant consequences.

3. **Maintenance Projects**: Create projects that must receive regular progress or else trigger negative events.

### Variable Time Scales

Adapt the system to handle different time scales:

1. **Mixed Units**: Use different "when" values for different campaign phases (days during critical periods, weeks during downtime).

2. **Flashbacks**: Use events with "when" values in the past to retroactively establish what happened before the campaign began.

3. **Fast-Forward**: For long campaigns, periodically increment "when" values by larger amounts to represent significant time passing.

## Conclusion

Faction Manager is a flexible tool that can adapt to your specific GMing style and campaign needs. The tips and techniques above are just starting points - as you use the system, you'll discover your own best practices that work for your game and players.
